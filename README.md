# 10 Academy Week 3: Insurance Risk Analytics & Predictive Modeling

## Overview
This repository contains the code and deliverables for Week 3 of the 10 Academy AI Mastery Bootcamp, focusing on analyzing car insurance data for AlphaCare Insurance Solutions (ACIS). The goal is to identify low-risk customer segments and build predictive models to optimize premiums.

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover risk and profitability patterns.
- Implement Data Version Control (DVC) for dataset management.
- Conduct A/B hypothesis testing to validate risk drivers.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models for claim severity and premium optimization.

## Repository Structure
- `/data`: Stores raw and processed datasets (tracked with DVC).
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling.
- `/scripts`: Python scripts for data processing and modeling.
- `/reports`: Interim and final reports.
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.
